### Scaling Ingress Controller in Kubernetes Cluster to Handle High Traffic

Scaling Ingress Controller in Kubernetes Cluster to Handle High Traffic
When deploying your application in a Kubernetes cluster, having sufficient resources on your nodes is just part of the equation. During traffic spikes, your application can still experience latency issues or timeouts, impacting customer experience. This can happen even if your application pods are scaled properly. The ingress controller, which manages incoming traffic, can become a bottleneck.

To address this, we need to scale the ingress controller based on HTTP requests. As depicted in the diagram below, the left image shows a single ingress controller handling a large amount of traffic, which can lead to latency issues or timeouts for customers. On the right, multiple ingress controller pods handle the traffic more efficiently by scaling based on active requests.

<img src="/assets/scale-ingress-controller.png" alt="nginx-ingress-controller" width="800" height="480" />
 
#### Steps to scale the ingress controller 
1. Expose Nginx Ingress Controller Metrics: [Docs for installation](https://kdf) & [Expose Metrics using Service Monitors](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/monitoring/)
2. Collect & store metrics using Prometheus: [Install Prometheus & Grafana using HELM chart]()
3. Use Autoscaler KEDA: [Docs for installation KEDA](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/deploy/) & apply this manifest [KEDA ScaledObject manifest](https://github.com/Saurabhkr952/dev-portfolio-manifest/blob/main/keda.yaml) 
 
If you want to see how application performs under high traffic with scaling controllers check the `monitoring` section 

### Migrate from Traditional Auto-scaling group to Karpenter

Migrating to Karpenter offers `fast scaling` and `cost savings`. Its consolidation feature efficiently packs workloads onto nodes, minimizing resource waste and maximizing cost-effectiveness. It's a smart move for boosting scalability and optimizing expenses.

As I've already provisioned infrastructure using cluster auto-scaling groups, here's the [documentation](https://karpenter.sh/docs/getting-started/migrating-from-cas/) detailing the migration process to Karpenter.

Want to see how it scales. check the [Scaling Node using Karpenter](#scaling-node-using-karpenter) section.

### Secure Kubernetes API with Rate Limiting

Rate limiting within an NGINX Ingress Controller allows you to manage the flow of traffic or requests to your backend services within specific timeframes. This feature is crucial for preventing abuse, ensuring equitable usage, and safeguarding your services from potential overload due to excessive requests.

To implement rate limiting, follow the instructions provided in the [documentation](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#rate-limiting) by configuring annotations accordingly. These annotations define the rate limiting policies for your Kubernetes environment, ensuring a secure and stable API infrastructure.


## Securing Kubernetes Cluster

To ensure the security of the Kubernetes cluster for the **Dev Portfolio** project, the following measures have been implemented:

- [x] **Distroless Image Usage:** Utilized distroless images, containing only essential packages, to build Docker images, reducing vulnerability exposure.
- [x] **Container Runtime Security:** Ensured container runtime security by running containers as non-root users.
- [x] **Docker Image Signing:** Implemented Docker image signing using COSIGN to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of container images.
- [x] **Image Scanning:** Integrated Trivy into the CI/CD pipeline for thorough image and container scanning, enhancing security posture.
- [x] **Security Scanning:** Leveraged Kubescape for comprehensive security scanning based on NSA and MITRE guidelines.
- [x] **CIS Benchmark Adherence:** Adhered to Kubernetes CIS benchmarks for robust security standards and best practices.
- [x] **Secrets Management:** Safeguarded Kubernetes secrets using sealed secrets, ensuring encrypted and tamper-proof storage.
- [ ] **Network Policies:** Not needed.
- [ ] **RBAC Implementation:** Managed User & Permissions within Kubernetes using RBAC, ensuring granular control over access and actions. 
- [ ] **mTLS Communication:** Not needed. 
- [x] **etcd Security:** Secured the etcd data store, a critical component of Kubernetes, to safeguard cluster configuration and state. (As it is managed Kubernetes cluster so we don't need to worry about etcd. AWS takes responsibility for securing the control plane components, including etcd, as part of the managed service offering.)

### Configure HTTPS with TLS Using Let's Encrypt
- To ensure secure traffic to our application, we use Cert-Manager, a popular Kubernetes add-on that automates the management and renewal of TLS certificates. This setup guarantees that our application remains accessible over HTTPS with certificates that automatically renew every three months. 
- If you want to know more about how to configure HTTPS checkout this repo: [dev-portfolio-manifests/configure-https](https://github.com/saurabhkr952/dev-portfolio-manifests)

2. Under the security settings, access the 'Secrets and Variables' section.
3. Inside the 'Secrets and Variables' section, proceed to the 'Actions' subsection.
4. Add the following repository secrets:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your DockerHub username.
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your DockerHub password.
   - `PAT_TOKEN`: Your GitHub Personal Access Token.
   - `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: Your Slack webhook URL. Refer to this [guide](https://devopseasyinitiate.hashnode.dev/how-to-get-slack-webhook-url) on how to obtain the URL.

### Install Argo CD on EKS

Refer to the [official Argo CD documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/) to install Argo CD on your **EKS cluster**.

## Workflow Steps

Here's how the CI/CD pipeline works:

1. Developers push code to the GitHub repository.
2. GitHub Actions automatically triggers a workflow when new code is pushed.
3. The workflow starts by building the Docker image and then pushing it to DockerHub.  
4. After the Docker image is successfully pushed, the workflow scans the container for vulnerabilities.
5. Following the vulnerability scan, the workflow updates the Kubernetes manifests in the Git repository with the new image tag.
6. **Argo CD** continuously monitors the Git repository and updates the application version in the Kubernetes cluster.   
7. Security vulnerabilities are reported and can be reviewed in the security tab.
   ![Security Vulnerabilities](https://github.com/Saurabhkr952/dev-portfolio/assets/32189783/f0ce9f6d-ae90-48ef-9fad-82b3ef3e0e5e)   
8. After the workflow is successfully completed, the status is reflected as shown below:
   ![cicd pipeline status](https://github.com/Saurabhkr952/dev-portfolio/assets/32189783/1634442e-2d86-4593-8e03-ad0e1614a6af)    
9. Notifications are sent to **Slack** to provide information about the workflow status.
   ![Workflow Status](https://github.com/Saurabhkr952/dev-portfolio/assets/32189783/d4b5490c-b4d9-4607-a999-d371c7c0afc5)


## Testing & Monitoring
### Load Testing
Load testing is an essential aspect of ensuring the stability and performance of your Kubernetes cluster. We employ `k6s` for load testing, which allows us to simulate traffic and analyze how our system responds under high loads. By scripting test scenarios with k6s, we can assess the scalability and resilience of our Kubernetes setup.


#### Monitor Nginx Ingress Controller
To monitor the performance of our nginx-ingress-controller, we utilize Grafana dashboards.
![grafana-dashboard-1](/assets/1.5k-req-sec-1.png)
![grafana-dashboard-2](/assets/1.5k-req-sec-2.png)

NOTE: We have already set-up prometheus and grafana & exposing nginx ingress controller in [Scaling Ingress Controller in Kubernetes Cluster to Handle High Traffic](#scaling-ingress-controller-in-kubernetes-cluster-to-handle-high-traffic) section. 

### For monitoring and visualization, the following tools are utilized:

`Prometheus` and `Grafana`. Prometheus serves as the data source for Grafana, enabling the visualization of metrics and performance data. A Grafana dashboard is employed to monitor the Kubernetes cluster using data collected by Prometheus. 

Here's a preview of a Grafana dashboard monitoring the Kubernetes cluster:
